# Mystery Function

What does the `mystery()` function in the following piece of code do? Add your
answer to this markdown file.

```javascript
function mystery(a) {
    if(a.length == 1) return a[0];
    var foo = mystery(a.slice(1, a.length))
    if(foo > a[0]) return foo;
    else return a[0];
}
```
This function will take in as list and find the largest element of the list by recursevley calling the function (making the list smaller each time), if you input a sting it will find the "largest" letter in a sting and return that single letter.
